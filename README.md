# TODO

totally skipped:

- tests (unit/integ/e2e)

could expand with:

- auth
- prisma
- better SEO, analytics etc.. Could use next-seo for sitemaps and more
- actual FE work (quality mobile responsive designs)
- vault page can be restructured into better components

for quality teamwork & efficacy at least:

- prettier, ideally with improts sorting
- eslint
- dev QOL improvements e.g. absolute imports (tsconfig),

no design system?

- tailwind, tailwind-merge etc..

... much more ...

# Fanvue's Fullstack challenge

Setup the project:

Make sure you install all the dependencies (currently yarn, but you can opt-out) and start the solution in dev mode.

There is a simple homepage with links to the tasks below.

First Task:

- in the "feed" page, show a centered column of posts (use https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ to get the data) which are simple boxes with the title and body properties returned
- for each post, fetch its relative comments and show the counter, or nothing if there are no comments
- when clicking on the comment counter, the comments appear below it

Second Task:

- create a "vault" page, showing a responsive grid of square pictures (use https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ to get the data) which are simple thumbnails
- when clicking on a thumbnail, the fullscreen image opens

Touch base on the following:

- SSR considerations, if you have time, implement a simple server-side rendering
- Type the responses from the API calls
- create meaningful tags in the head of each page, or any other SEO consideration
- add the favicon stealing it from fanvue.com ;)
- a11y considerations

Note:

- Styling is not required, you should use MUI5 components out-of-the box, check docs here https://mui.com/material-ui/
- You can install your favourite fetch library, but you can also use the built-in fetch API
